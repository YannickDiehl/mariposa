Warnings

 No measures of association are computed for the crosstabulation of Geschlecht * Höchster Bildungsabschluss for split file Region (Ost/West)=East. At least one variable in each 2-way table upon which measures of association are computed is a constant. 
 The file is not sorted in a consistent manner on the split file variables. It is likely that any procedure output will be incorrect.

Warnings

 No measures of association are computed for the crosstabulation of Geschlecht * Höchster Bildungsabschluss for split file Region (Ost/West)=East. At least one variable in each 2-way table upon which measures of association are computed is a constant. 
 The file is not sorted in a consistent manner on the split file variables. It is likely that any procedure output will be incorrect.

Warnings

 No measures of association are computed for the crosstabulation of Region (Ost/West) * Höchster Bildungsabschluss for split file Geschlecht=Female. At least one variable in each 2-way table upon which measures of association are computed is a constant. 
 The file is not sorted in a consistent manner on the split file variables.

Warnings

 No measures of association are computed for the crosstabulation of Höchster Bildungsabschluss * Erwerbsstatus for split file Geschlecht=Female. At least one variable in each 2-way table upon which measures of association are computed is a constant. 
 The file is not sorted in a consistent manner on the split file variables.

Warnings

 The variable Geschlecht is in use for SPLIT FILES, so it may not be used in a CROSSTABS command. 
 Execution of this command stops.

================================================================
NOTES ON CHI-SQUARED TEST STATISTICS:
----------------------------------------------------------------

Chi-squared statistic: sum((O-E)^2/E)
Degrees of freedom: (rows-1) * (columns-1)

Effect Size Measures:
  Phi coefficient: sqrt(chi-squared/N) - for 2x2 tables
  Cramers V: sqrt(chi-squared/(N*min(r-1,c-1))) - for any size
  Contingency coefficient: sqrt(chi-squared/(chi-squared+N))

Continuity Correction (Yates):
  Applied automatically in SPSS for 2x2 tables
  Reduces chi-squared value for small samples

Weighted Analysis:
  Uses frequency weights for cell counts
  Affects both observed and expected frequencies
