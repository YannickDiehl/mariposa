# mariposa 0.1.0

## Breaking Changes

* `gamma()` has been renamed to `goodman_gamma()` to avoid shadowing `base::gamma()`.
  The function remains an alias for `chi_square()` and works identically.

* S3 class names unified: removed `_results` suffix from all result classes
  (e.g., `chi_square_results` -> `chi_square`, `t_test_results` -> `t_test`).
  Class names now match the function name that created them.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed namespace collisions from triple-defined internal helper functions
  (`.process_variables()`, `.process_weights()`, `.effective_n()`). These are now
  defined once in `helpers.R` and shared across all functions.

* Fixed weighted variance/SD formula inconsistency. All weighted calculations now
  use the SPSS frequency weights formula: `sum(w * (x - w_mean)^2) / (V1 - 1)`.

* Fixed Gamma ASE (asymptotic standard error) calculation. Replaced empirical
  magic-number formula with the correct ASE0 formula from Agresti (2002).

* Fixed weighted Cohen's d calculation in `t_test()`. Previously multiplied
  values by weights (`x * w`); now uses proper weighted means and pooled
  weighted standard deviation.

* Fixed weighted kurtosis formula. Changed from population excess kurtosis
  (`m4/m2^2 - 3`) to SPSS Type 2 sample-corrected formula
  (`G2 = ((n+1)*g2 + 6) * (n-1) / ((n-2)*(n-3))`), matching SPSS output.

## Improvements

* Refactored 9 of 11 `w_*` functions to use a shared factory pattern
  (`R/w_factory.R`). Eliminated ~2,460 lines of duplicated boilerplate
  (4,204 → 1,740 lines, -58.6%). `w_modus` and `w_quantile` remain
  standalone due to their fundamentally different interfaces.

* Added 83 SPSS validation tests for all `w_*` functions across 4 scenarios
  (weighted/unweighted × grouped/ungrouped) in
  `test-weighted-statistics-spss-validation.R`.

* Reduced memory usage: result objects now store only the columns needed for
  post-hoc tests instead of the full input data frame.

* Unified print helper system: all output formatting now uses `print_helpers.R`.
  Removed deprecated `.print_header()`, `.print_border()`, `.get_border()`, and
  `.print_group_header()` from `helpers.R`.

* Deduplicated `t_test.R` print methods: `print.t_test_results` and
  `print.t_test_result` now share a common implementation (~360 fewer lines).

* Added input validation:
  - `t_test()`: validates `conf.level` is between 0 and 1
  - `t_test()`, `oneway_anova()`: validate that selected variables are numeric
  - `chi_square()`: warns when expected cell counts < 5

* Migrated error handling from `stop()`/`warning()` to `cli_abort()`/`cli_warn()`
  with structured messages, `{.arg}` and `{.var}` markup, and pluralization support.

* Added `cli` as dependency for professional user-facing messages and print output.

* Added `@family` tags to all 24 exported functions for cross-referencing in
  documentation (families: descriptive, hypothesis_tests, correlation, posthoc,
  weighted_statistics).

* Added `tests/testthat/helper-mariposa.R` with shared test utilities and
  centralized SPSS validation tolerances.

* Migrated `print_helpers.R` infrastructure to `cli` (`cli_rule()`,
  `cli_bullets()`, `cli_h2()`).

* Extended `globals.R` with missing NSE variable declarations.

* Fixed "SURVEYSTAT" reference in `imports.R`.
