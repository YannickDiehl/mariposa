\title{Compare All Groups More Conservatively After ANOVA}
\usage{
scheffe_test(x, conf.level = 0.95, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{ANOVA results from \code{oneway_anova()}}

\item{conf.level}{Confidence level for intervals (Default: 0.95 = 95\%)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused)}
}
\value{
Pairwise comparison results showing:
\itemize{
\item Which group pairs are significantly different
\item Size of the difference between each pair
\item Adjusted p-values (extra conservative)
\item Confidence intervals for each difference
}
}
\description{
\code{scheffe_test()} tells you which groups differ after ANOVA, using the most
conservative approach. It's like Tukey's test but even more careful about
avoiding false positives.

Think of it as:
\itemize{
\item The most cautious post-hoc test available
\item A way to compare groups when sample sizes are very unequal
\item Insurance against finding differences that aren't real
}
}
\details{
\subsection{Understanding the Results}{

\strong{Adjusted P-values}: Extra conservative to prevent false positives
\itemize{
\item p < 0.05: Groups are significantly different (you can be very confident)
\item p â‰¥ 0.05: No significant difference between these groups
\item Scheffe adjustments are stricter than other methods
}

\strong{Confidence Intervals}: Wider than Tukey's
\itemize{
\item Do not include 0: Groups differ significantly
\item Include 0: No significant difference
\item Wider intervals reflect extra caution
}
}

\subsection{When to Use Scheffe Test}{

Use Scheffe test when:
\itemize{
\item Your ANOVA shows significant differences (p < 0.05)
\item Group sizes are very unequal
\item You want to be extra cautious about false positives
\item You might test complex comparisons (not just pairs)
\item Sample sizes are small
}
}

\subsection{Scheffe vs. Tukey}{

\strong{Scheffe Test:}
\itemize{
\item Most conservative (hardest to find differences)
\item Best for unequal group sizes
\item Protects against all possible comparisons
\item Wider confidence intervals
}

\strong{Tukey Test:}
\itemize{
\item Less conservative (easier to find differences)
\item Best for equal group sizes
\item Protects only pairwise comparisons
\item Narrower confidence intervals
}
}

\subsection{Reading the Output}{

Example: "Group A - Group B: Diff = 3.2, p = 0.082"
\itemize{
\item Group A's average is 3.2 units higher than Group B's
\item This difference is NOT significant with Scheffe (p > 0.05)
\item It might be significant with less conservative tests
}
}

\subsection{Tips for Success}{
\itemize{
\item Scheffe may not find differences even when ANOVA does
\item This is normal - it's being extra careful
\item Consider Tukey if group sizes are similar
\item Report which post-hoc test you used and why
\item Focus on confidence intervals, not just p-values
}

# Load required packages and data

# Perform ANOVA followed by Scheffe post-hoc test

# Scheffe post-hoc comparisons
anova_result \%>\% scheffe_test()

# Multiple variables
anova_result_multi <- survey_data \%>\%
  oneway_anova(life_satisfaction, income, group = education)

anova_result_multi \%>\% scheffe_test()

# Weighted analysis
anova_weighted <- survey_data \%>\%
  oneway_anova(life_satisfaction, group = education, weights = sampling_weight)

anova_weighted \%>\% scheffe_test()

# Grouped analysis
anova_grouped <- survey_data \%>\%
  group_by(region) \%>\%
  oneway_anova(life_satisfaction, group = education)

anova_grouped \%>\% scheffe_test()

# Custom confidence level (99\%)
anova_result \%>\% scheffe_test(conf.level = 0.99)
