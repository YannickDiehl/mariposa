\title{Compare Multiple Groups: Are Their Averages Different?}
\usage{
oneway_anova(
  data,
  ...,
  group,
  weights = NULL,
  var.equal = TRUE,
  conf.level = 0.95
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Your survey data (a data frame or tibble)}

\item{...}{The numeric variables you want to analyze. You can list multiple
variables or use helpers like \code{starts_with("income")}}

\item{group}{The categorical variable that defines your groups (e.g., education,
region, age_group). Must have at least 3 groups for ANOVA.}

\item{weights}{Optional survey weights for population-representative results}

\item{var.equal}{Should we assume all groups have similar variance? (Default: TRUE)
\itemize{
\item TRUE: Standard ANOVA (assumes equal variances)
\item FALSE: Welch's ANOVA (allows unequal variances)
}}

\item{conf.level}{Confidence level for group statistics (Default: 0.95 = 95\%)}
}
\value{
ANOVA results showing whether groups differ, including:
\itemize{
\item F-statistic and p-value (are groups different?)
\item Effect sizes (how much do groups matter?)
\item Group statistics (means and standard deviations)
\item Both standard and Welch ANOVA results
}
}
\description{
\code{oneway_anova()} helps you determine if average values differ across
three or more groups. For example, does average income vary by education level?
Or is customer satisfaction different across regions?

Think of it as:
\itemize{
\item An extension of t-test for more than two groups
\item A way to test if group membership affects outcomes
\item A tool to identify meaningful group differences
}

The test tells you:
\itemize{
\item Whether at least one group is different from the others
\item How much variation is explained by group membership
\item Which variance assumption fits your data best
}
}
\details{
\subsection{Understanding the Results}{

\strong{P-value}: If p < 0.05, at least one group average is different
\itemize{
\item p < 0.001: Very strong evidence of group differences
\item p < 0.01: Strong evidence of group differences
\item p < 0.05: Moderate evidence of group differences
\item p â‰¥ 0.05: No significant group differences found
}

\strong{Effect Sizes} (How much do groups matter?):
\itemize{
\item \strong{Eta-squared}: Proportion of variance explained by groups
\itemize{
\item < 0.01: Negligible effect
\item 0.01-0.06: Small effect
\item 0.06-0.14: Medium effect
\item 0.14 or higher: Large effect
}
\item \strong{Omega-squared}: More conservative estimate (usually preferred)
}
}

\subsection{When to Use This}{

Use ANOVA when:
\itemize{
\item You have one numeric outcome (income, satisfaction score, etc.)
\item You have one categorical grouping variable with 3+ groups
\item You want to know if group averages differ
\item Your data is roughly normally distributed within groups
}
}

\subsection{Choosing Variance Assumptions}{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Standard ANOVA} (var.equal = TRUE): Use when group variances are similar
\item \strong{Welch's ANOVA} (var.equal = FALSE): Use when group variances differ or you're unsure
\item The function shows both results for comparison
}
}

\subsection{What Comes Next?}{

If ANOVA is significant:
\enumerate{
\item Look at group means to see the pattern
\item Use \code{tukey_test()} to find which specific groups differ
\item Consider effect sizes to judge practical importance
}
}

\subsection{Tips for Success}{
\itemize{
\item Check that each group has sufficient observations (ideally 20+)
\item Look at both p-values and effect sizes
\item Use Welch's ANOVA if group sizes are very unequal
\item Follow up with post-hoc tests to identify specific differences
\item Welch's robust test for equality of means
}
}

\subsection{Interpretation Guidelines}{
\itemize{
\item \strong{p-values}: p < 0.05 indicates significant group differences at alpha = 0.05
\item \strong{Effect sizes}: eta-squared ~ 0.01 (small), eta-squared ~ 0.06 (medium), eta-squared ~ 0.14 (large)
\item \strong{Eta-squared}: Proportion of variance explained (tends to overestimate)
\item \strong{Epsilon-squared}: Less biased than eta-squared
\item \strong{Omega-squared}: Unbiased estimate (preferred for publication)
