\description{
A synthetic dataset modeled after large-scale social surveys
with demographics, attitudes, and survey design features. Created for
testing and demonstration purposes without licensing concerns.
}
\details{
This dataset contains realistic patterns of correlation between variables:
\itemize{
\item Education correlates with income and political attitudes
\item Regional differences reflect East/West patterns
\item Age effects on employment and attitudes
\item Realistic missing data patterns (3-12\% depending on sensitivity)
\item Survey weights for post-stratification adjustment
}

The data includes proper variable labels and follows social survey conventions
for coding and structure. Generated with set.seed(2024) for reproducibility.
