\title{Test If Two Categories Are Related}
\usage{
chi_square(data, ..., weights = NULL, correct = FALSE)

phi(data, ..., weights = NULL, correct = FALSE)

cramers_v(data, ..., weights = NULL, correct = FALSE)

gamma(data, ..., weights = NULL, correct = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Your survey data (a data frame or tibble)}

\item{...}{Two categorical variables to test (e.g., gender, region)}

\item{weights}{Optional survey weights for population-representative results}

\item{correct}{Apply continuity correction for small samples? (Default: FALSE)}
}
\value{
Test results showing whether the variables are related, including:
\itemize{
\item Chi-squared statistic and p-value
\item Observed vs expected frequencies
\item Effect sizes to measure relationship strength
}
}
\description{
\code{chi_square()} helps you discover if two categorical variables are
related or independent. For example, is education level related to voting
preference? Or are they independent of each other?

The test tells you:
\itemize{
\item Whether the relationship is statistically significant
\item How strong the relationship is (effect sizes)
\item What patterns exist in your data
}
}
\details{
\subsection{Understanding the Results}{

\strong{P-value}: If p < 0.05, the variables are likely related (not independent)
\itemize{
\item p < 0.001: Very strong evidence of relationship
\item p < 0.01: Strong evidence of relationship
\item p < 0.05: Moderate evidence of relationship
\item p â‰¥ 0.05: No significant relationship found
}

\strong{Effect Sizes} (How strong is the relationship?):
\itemize{
\item \strong{Cramer's V}: Works for any table size (0 = no relationship, 1 = perfect relationship)
\itemize{
\item < 0.1: Negligible relationship
\item 0.1-0.3: Small relationship
\item 0.3-0.5: Medium relationship
\item 0.5 or higher: Large relationship
}
\item \strong{Phi}: Only for 2x2 tables (similar interpretation as Cramer's V)
\item \strong{Gamma}: For ordinal data (-1 to +1, shows direction of relationship)
}
}

\subsection{When to Use This}{

Use chi-squared test when:
\itemize{
\item Both variables are categorical (gender, region, education level, etc.)
\item You want to know if they're related or independent
\item You have at least 5 observations in most cells
}
}

\subsection{Reading the Frequency Tables}{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Observed}: What you actually found in your data
\item \strong{Expected}: What you'd expect if variables were independent
\item Large differences suggest a relationship exists
}
}

\subsection{Tips for Success}{
\itemize{
\item Check that most cells have at least 5 observations
\item Use weights for population estimates
\item Look at both significance (p-value) and strength (effect sizes)
\item Consider using crosstab() for detailed percentage breakdowns

# Load required packages and data
library(dplyr)
data(survey_data)

# Basic chi-squared test for independence
survey_data \%>\% chi_square(gender, region)

# With weights
survey_data \%>\% chi_square(gender, education, weights = sampling_weight)

# Grouped analysis
survey_data \%>\% 
  group_by(region) \%>\% 
  chi_square(gender, employment)

# With continuity correction
survey_data \%>\% chi_square(gender, region, correct = TRUE)
