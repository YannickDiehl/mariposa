\usage{
crosstab(
  data,
  row,
  col,
  weights = NULL,
  percentages = c("row", "none", "col", "total", "all"),
  na.rm = TRUE,
  digits = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Your survey data (a data frame or tibble)}

\item{row}{The variable for table rows (e.g., education, age_group)}

\item{col}{The variable for table columns (e.g., region, gender)}

\item{weights}{Optional survey weights for population-representative results}

\item{percentages}{Which percentages to show:
\itemize{
\item \code{"row"} (default): Percentages across each row (adds to 100\% horizontally)
\item \code{"col"}: Percentages down each column (adds to 100\% vertically)
\item \code{"total"}: Percentage of the entire table
\item \code{"all"}: Show all three types
\item \code{"none"}: Just counts, no percentages
}}

\item{na.rm}{Remove missing values? (Default: TRUE)}

\item{digits}{Decimal places for percentages (Default: 1)}
}
\value{
A cross-tabulation table showing the relationship between two variables
}
\description{
\code{crosstab()} shows you how two categorical variables relate to each other.
It creates a table that reveals patterns - like whether education level differs
by region, or if gender influences product preferences.

Think of it as a two-way frequency table that shows:
\itemize{
\item How many people fall into each combination of categories
\item What percentage each cell represents
\item Whether there are patterns or associations
}
}
\details{
\subsection{Understanding the Output}{

The crosstab table shows:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Cell counts}: Number of people in each combination
\item \strong{Row \%}: Distribution within each row (e.g., "Among those with high school education, X\% live in the East")
\item \strong{Column \%}: Distribution within each column (e.g., "Among those in the East, X\% have high school education")
\item \strong{Total \%}: Percentage of the entire sample (e.g., "X\% of all respondents have high school education AND live in the East")
}
}

\subsection{When to Use This}{

Use crosstab when you want to:
\itemize{
\item See if two categorical variables are related
\item Compare distributions across groups
\item Find patterns in survey responses
\item Create demographic breakdowns
}
}

\subsection{Choosing Percentages}{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Row \%}: Use when your row variable is the grouping factor
(e.g., "How does region vary BY education level?")
\item \strong{Column \%}: Use when your column variable is the grouping factor
(e.g., "How does education vary BY region?")
\item \strong{Total \%}: Use to understand the overall sample composition
}
}

\subsection{Tips for Success}{
\itemize{
\item Start with row or column percentages, not both at once
\item Use chi-squared test to check if the relationship is statistically significant
\item Watch for small cell counts (< 5) which may be unreliable
\item Consider combining sparse categories if many cells are empty

\examples{
# Load required packages and data
library(dplyr)
data(survey_data)

# Basic crosstab
survey_data \%>\% crosstab(gender, region)

# With weights and all percentages
survey_data \%>\% crosstab(gender, education,
                         weights = sampling_weight,
                         percentages = "all")

# Grouped analysis
survey_data \%>\%
  group_by(employment) \%>\%
  crosstab(gender, region, weights = sampling_weight)

# Column percentages only
survey_data \%>\% crosstab(education, employment, percentages = "col")

}
