\title{Find Which Specific Groups Differ After ANOVA}
\usage{
tukey_test(x, conf.level = 0.95, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{ANOVA results from \code{oneway_anova()}}

\item{conf.level}{Confidence level for intervals (Default: 0.95 = 95\%)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused)}
}
\value{
Pairwise comparison results showing:
\itemize{
\item Which group pairs are significantly different
\item Size of the difference between each pair
\item Adjusted p-values (controlling for multiple comparisons)
\item Confidence intervals for each difference
}
}
\description{
\code{tukey_test()} tells you exactly which groups are different from each other
after ANOVA finds overall differences. It's like a follow-up investigation that
pinpoints where the differences lie.

Think of it as:
\itemize{
\item ANOVA says "there are differences somewhere"
\item Tukey test says "specifically, Group A differs from Group C"
\item A way to make all possible comparisons while controlling error rates
}
}
\details{
\subsection{Understanding the Results}{

\strong{Adjusted P-values}: Control for multiple comparisons
\itemize{
\item p < 0.05: Groups are significantly different
\item p ≥ 0.05: No significant difference between these groups
\item When you make many comparisons, chance alone could produce false positives
\item Tukey adjustment protects against this by being more conservative
}

\strong{Mean Differences}:
\itemize{
\item Positive: First group has higher average than second
\item Negative: Second group has higher average than first
\item Zero in confidence interval: No significant difference
}
}

\subsection{When to Use Tukey Test}{

Use Tukey test when:
\itemize{
\item Your ANOVA shows significant differences (p < 0.05)
\item You want to know which specific groups differ
\item You need to compare all possible pairs
\item Group sizes are roughly equal
\item Variances are roughly equal across groups
}
}

\subsection{Tukey vs. Scheffe}{

\strong{Tukey Test:}
\itemize{
\item Less conservative (easier to find differences)
\item Best for equal group sizes
\item Protects only pairwise comparisons
\item Narrower confidence intervals
}

\strong{Scheffe Test:}
\itemize{
\item Most conservative (hardest to find differences)
\item Best for unequal group sizes
\item Protects against all possible comparisons
\item Wider confidence intervals
}
}

\subsection{Reading the Output}{

Example: "Group A - Group B: Diff = 3.2, p = 0.012"
\itemize{
\item Group A's average is 3.2 units higher than Group B's
\item This difference is statistically significant (p < 0.05)
\item You can be confident these groups truly differ
}
}

\subsection{Tips for Success}{
\itemize{
\item Only run post-hoc tests if ANOVA is significant
\item Focus on comparisons that make theoretical sense
\item Consider practical significance, not just statistical
\item Report both the difference and its confidence interval
\item Remember: non-significant doesn't mean "exactly equal"
}

# Load required packages and data

# Perform ANOVA followed by Tukey post-hoc test
anova_result <- survey_data \%>\%
  oneway_anova(life_satisfaction, group = education)

# Tukey post-hoc comparisons
anova_result \%>\% tukey_test()

# With weights

  oneway_anova(life_satisfaction, group = education, weights = sampling_weight)

anova_weighted \%>\% tukey_test()

# Multiple variables
anova_multi <- survey_data \%>\%
  oneway_anova(trust_government, trust_companies, group = education)

anova_multi \%>\% tukey_test()

# Grouped analysis
anova_grouped <- survey_data \%>\%
  group_by(region) \%>\%
  oneway_anova(life_satisfaction, group = education)

anova_grouped \%>\% tukey_test()
