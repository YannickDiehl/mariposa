\title{Test If Two Groups Differ}
\usage{
t_test(
  data,
  ...,
  group = NULL,
  weights = NULL,
  var.equal = FALSE,
  mu = 0,
  alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),
  conf.level = 0.95
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Your survey data (a data frame or tibble)}

\item{...}{The numeric variables to test. List multiple variables or use
tidyselect helpers like \code{starts_with("trust")}.}

\item{group}{The variable that defines your two groups (e.g., gender, region).
Must have exactly two categories. Leave empty for one-sample tests.}

\item{weights}{Optional survey weights for population-representative results}

\item{var.equal}{Should we assume equal variances? (Default: FALSE)
\itemize{
\item \code{FALSE}: Safer, works even if groups vary differently (Welch's test)
\item \code{TRUE}: Traditional approach, assumes equal spread (Student's test)
}}

\item{mu}{Comparison value (Default: 0). For two-sample tests, usually 0.
For one-sample tests, your benchmark value.}

\item{alternative}{Direction of the test:
\itemize{
\item \code{"two.sided"} (default): Any difference
\item \code{"greater"}: First group is higher
\item \code{"less"}: First group is lower
}}

\item{conf.level}{Confidence level (Default: 0.95 = 95\%)}
}
\value{
Test results showing whether groups differ, including:
\itemize{
\item t-statistic and p-value for statistical significance
\item Mean difference and confidence interval
\item Effect sizes (Cohen's d, Hedges' g, Glass' Delta)
\item Group statistics (mean, SD, sample size)
}
}
\description{
\code{t_test()} helps you determine if two groups have different average values.
For example, do men and women have different satisfaction scores? Does Region A
spend more than Region B? Is this year better than last year?

The test tells you:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Whether the difference is statistically significant}
\item \strong{How big the difference is} (effect sizes)
\item \strong{The likely range of the true difference} (confidence interval)
}
}
\details{
\subsection{Understanding the Results}{

\strong{P-value}: Is the difference statistically significant?
\itemize{
\item p < 0.001: Very strong evidence of a difference
\item p < 0.01: Strong evidence of a difference
\item p < 0.05: Moderate evidence of a difference
\item p ≥ 0.05: No significant difference found
}

\strong{Effect Sizes} (How big is the difference?):
\itemize{
\item \strong{Cohen's d}: The standard measure
\itemize{
\item |d| < 0.2: Negligible difference
\item |d| = 0.2-0.5: Small difference
\item |d| = 0.5-0.8: Medium difference
\item |d| > 0.8: Large difference
}
\item \strong{Hedges' g}: Corrected for small samples
\item \strong{Glass' Delta}: Uses control group SD only
}

\strong{Confidence Interval}: Range where the true difference likely falls
\itemize{
\item If it includes 0, groups may not differ
\item Width indicates precision (narrower = more precise)
}
}

\subsection{When to Use This}{

Use t-test when:
\itemize{
\item You have exactly two groups to compare
\item Your outcome variable is numeric (continuous)
\item Groups are independent (different people in each)
\item Data is roughly normally distributed (or n ≥ 30 per group)
}

Don't use when:
\itemize{
\item You have more than two groups (use ANOVA)
\item Data is severely skewed with small samples (use Mann-Whitney)
\item Groups are paired/matched (use paired t-test - coming soon)
\item Variables are categorical (use chi-square)
}
}

\subsection{Reading the Output}{

The results show both variance assumptions:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Welch's test} (var.equal = FALSE): Safer, doesn't assume equal variances
\item \strong{Student's test} (var.equal = TRUE): Traditional, assumes equal variances
}

A result with t = 2.45, p = 0.015, d = 0.62 means:
\itemize{
\item Groups are 2.45 standard errors apart (t-statistic)
\item 1.5\% chance this is due to random variation (p-value)
\item Medium-sized practical difference (Cohen's d)
}
}

\subsection{Tips for Success}{
\itemize{
\item Always check sample sizes (aim for 30+ per group)
\item Consider both statistical significance AND effect size
\item Use weights for population-level conclusions
\item Plot your data first to check assumptions
\item Report confidence intervals along with p-values
}
