\usage{
levene_test(x, ...)

\method{levene_test}{data.frame}(x, ..., group, weights = NULL, center = c("mean", "median"))

\method{levene_test}{oneway_anova}(x, center = c("mean", "median"), ...)

\method{levene_test}{t_test}(x, center = c("mean", "median"), ...)

\method{levene_test}{mann_whitney}(x, ...)

\method{levene_test}{grouped_df}(x, variable, group = NULL, weights = NULL, center = "mean", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Either your data or test results from \code{t_test()} or \code{oneway_anova()}}

\item{...}{Variables to test (when using data frame)}

\item{group}{The grouping variable for comparison}

\item{weights}{Optional survey weights for population-representative results}

\item{center}{How to measure center: \code{"mean"} (default) or \code{"median"} (more robust)}

\item{data}{Your survey data (when x is not a test result)}
}
\value{
Test results showing:
\itemize{
\item Whether groups have equal variances (p-value)
\item F-statistic measuring variance differences
\item Which variables meet the assumption
}
}
\description{
\code{levene_test()} checks if different groups have similar amounts of variation.
This is an important assumption for many statistical tests - groups should spread
out in similar ways.

The test tells you:
\itemize{
\item Whether variance is consistent across groups
\item If you can trust standard ANOVA and t-test results
\item When to use alternative tests that don't assume equal variance
}
}
\details{
\subsection{Understanding the Results}{

\strong{P-value interpretation}:
\itemize{
\item p > 0.05: Good! Groups have similar variance (assumption met)
\item p ≤ 0.05: Problem - groups vary differently (assumption violated)
}

Think of it like checking if all groups are equally "spread out":
\itemize{
\item Similar spread = can use standard tests
\item Different spread = need special methods
}
}

\subsection{When to Use This}{

Check variance equality when:
\itemize{
\item Before running t-tests or ANOVA
\item Comparing groups with different sizes
\item Your statistical test assumes equal variances
\item You see very different standard deviations
}
}

\subsection{What If Variances Are Unequal?}{

If Levene's test is significant (p ≤ 0.05):
\itemize{
\item For t-tests: Use Welch's t-test (var.equal = FALSE)
\item For ANOVA: Use Welch's ANOVA
\item Consider transforming your data
\item Use non-parametric alternatives
\item Report that equal variance assumption was violated
}
}

\subsection{Usage Flexibility}{

You can use this function two ways:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Standalone}: Check any variables for equal variance
\item \strong{After tests}: Pipe after t_test() or oneway_anova() to verify assumptions
}
}

\subsection{Tips for Success}{
\itemize{
\item Always check this assumption for group comparisons
\item Visual inspection (boxplots) can supplement the test
\item Large samples make the test very sensitive
\item Use median-based test for skewed data (center = "median")
\item Don't panic if violated - alternatives exist!

\examples{
# Load required packages and data
library(dplyr)
data(survey_data)

# Standalone Levene test (test homogeneity of variances)
survey_data \%>\% levene_test(life_satisfaction, group = region)

# Multiple variables
survey_data \%>\% levene_test(life_satisfaction, trust_government, group = region)

# Weighted analysis
survey_data \%>\% levene_test(income, group = education, weights = sampling_weight)

# Piped after ANOVA (common workflow)
result <- survey_data \%>\%
  oneway_anova(life_satisfaction, group = education)
result \%>\% levene_test()

# Piped after t-test
survey_data \%>\%
  t_test(age, group = gender) \%>\%
  levene_test()

# Using mean instead of median as center
survey_data \%>\% levene_test(income, group = region, center = "mean")
