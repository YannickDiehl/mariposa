\usage{
frequency(
  data,
  ...,
  weights = NULL,
  sort.frq = "none",
  show.na = TRUE,
  show.prc = TRUE,
  show.valid = TRUE,
  show.sum = TRUE,
  show.labels = "auto"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Your survey data (a data frame or tibble)}

\item{...}{The categorical variables you want to analyze. You can list multiple
variables separated by commas, or use helpers like \code{starts_with("trust")}}

\item{weights}{Optional survey weights to make results representative of your
population. Without weights, you get sample frequencies. With weights, you
get population estimates.}

\item{sort.frq}{How to order the results:
\itemize{
\item \code{"none"} (default): Keep original order
\item \code{"asc"}: Sort from lowest to highest frequency
\item \code{"desc"}: Sort from highest to lowest frequency
}}

\item{show.na}{Include missing values in the table? (Default: TRUE)}

\item{show.prc}{Show raw percentages including missing values? (Default: TRUE)}

\item{show.valid}{Show percentages excluding missing values? (Default: TRUE)}

\item{show.sum}{Show cumulative totals? (Default: TRUE)}

\item{show.labels}{Show category labels if available? (Default: "auto" - shows
labels when they exist)}
}
\value{
A frequency table showing counts and percentages for each category
}
\description{
\code{frequency()} helps you understand categorical data by showing how many people
chose each option. It's perfect for survey questions with fixed choices like
education level, yes/no questions, or rating scales.

Think of it as creating a summary table that shows:
\itemize{
\item How many people chose each option
\item What percentage that represents
\item Running totals to see cumulative patterns
}
}
\details{
\subsection{Understanding the Output}{

The frequency table shows:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Freq}: Number of responses in each category
\item \strong{\%}: Percentage including missing values (use for "response rate")
\item \strong{Valid \%}: Percentage excluding missing values (use for "among those who answered")
\item \strong{Cum \%}: Running total percentage (helps identify cutoff points)
}
}

\subsection{When to Use This}{

Use \code{frequency()} when you have:
\itemize{
\item Categorical variables (gender, region, education level)
\item Yes/No questions
\item Rating scales (satisfied/neutral/dissatisfied)
\item Any question with a fixed set of options
}
}

\subsection{Weights Make a Difference}{

Without weights, you're describing your sample. With weights, you're estimating
population values. Always use weights for population inference.

\examples{
# Load required packages and data
library(dplyr)
data(survey_data)

# Basic categorical analysis
survey_data \%>\% frequency(gender)

# Multiple variables with weights
survey_data \%>\% frequency(gender, region, weights = sampling_weight)

# Grouped analysis by region
survey_data \%>\% 
  group_by(region) \%>\% 
  frequency(gender, weights = sampling_weight)

# Education levels with sorting
survey_data \%>\% frequency(education, sort.frq = "desc")

# Employment status with custom display options
survey_data \%>\% frequency(employment, weights = sampling_weight, 
                         show.na = TRUE, show.sum = TRUE)
