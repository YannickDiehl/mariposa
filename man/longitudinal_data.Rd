\title{Longitudinal Study Data (Synthetic)}
\format{
A data frame with 480 rows and 10 variables:
\describe{
\item{subject_id}{Subject identifier (factor, 1-120)}
\item{group}{Treatment group (Control, Treatment)}
\item{age}{Age in years (numeric)}
\item{gender}{Gender (Male, Female)}
\item{time}{Time point (T1, T2, T3, T4)}
\item{time_numeric}{Time point as numeric (1-4)}
\item{outcome_score}{Primary outcome measure (continuous)}
\item{secondary_outcome}{Secondary outcome measure (continuous)}
\item{physio_measure}{Physiological measure (continuous)}
\item{questionnaire_score}{Questionnaire rating (ordered factor, 1-7)}
}
}
\source{
Generated synthetically with realistic longitudinal correlation
patterns and treatment effects. No real study data was used.
}
\usage{
longitudinal_data
}
\description{
A synthetic repeated measures dataset suitable for testing longitudinal
analysis functions. Contains realistic treatment effects, missing data
patterns, and within-subject correlations.
}
\details{
Study design features:
\itemize{
\item 120 subjects (60 per group)
\item 4 measurement occasions
\item Balanced treatment assignment
\item Realistic dropout patterns (0\% at T1, 35\% by T4)
\item Treatment effect grows over time (interaction effect)
\item Autoregressive error structure
\item Effect size approximately Cohen's d = 0.6
}

Missing data patterns reflect realistic longitudinal study attrition with
higher dropout in later time points. The treatment effect demonstrates
a clear Group x Time interaction suitable for repeated measures testing.
