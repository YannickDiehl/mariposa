\title{Get to Know Your Numeric Data}
\usage{
describe(
  data,
  ...,
  weights = NULL,
  show = "short",
  probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75),
  na.rm = TRUE,
  excess = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Your survey data (a data frame or tibble)}

\item{...}{The numeric variables you want to summarize. List them separated by
commas, or use helpers like \code{starts_with("trust")}}

\item{weights}{Optional survey weights to get population-representative statistics.
Without weights, you describe your sample. With weights, you describe the population.}

\item{show}{Which statistics to display:
\itemize{
\item \code{"short"} (default): Essential stats (mean, median, SD, range, IQR, skewness)
\item \code{"all"}: Everything including variance, kurtosis, mode, quantiles
\item Custom list: Choose specific stats like \code{c("mean", "sd", "range")}
}}

\item{probs}{For quantiles, which percentiles to show (default: 25th, 50th, 75th)}

\item{na.rm}{Remove missing values before calculating? (Default: TRUE)}

\item{excess}{For kurtosis, show excess kurtosis? (Default: TRUE, easier to interpret)}
}
\value{
A summary table with descriptive statistics for each variable
}
\description{
\code{describe()} gives you a complete summary of numeric variables - like age,
income, or satisfaction scores. It's your first step in any analysis, helping you
understand what's typical, what's unusual, and how spread out your data is.

Think of it as a health check for your data that reveals:
\itemize{
\item What's the average value?
\item What's the middle value?
\item How spread out are the responses?
\item Are there unusual patterns or outliers?
}
}
\details{
\subsection{Understanding the Output}{

Key statistics and what they tell you:
\itemize{
\item \strong{n}: How many valid responses (watch for too many missing)
\item \strong{Mean}: The average value
\item \strong{Median}: The middle value (half above, half below)
\item \strong{SD}: Standard deviation - how spread out values are
\item \strong{Range}: The minimum and maximum values
\item \strong{IQR}: Interquartile range - the middle 50\% of values
\item \strong{Skewness}: Whether data leans left (negative) or right (positive)
\item \strong{Kurtosis}: Whether you have unusual outliers
}
}

\subsection{When to Use This}{

Always start here! Use \code{describe()} to:
\itemize{
\item Check data quality (impossible values?)
\item Understand distributions before testing
\item Spot outliers that might affect analyses
\item Compare groups side by side
}
}

\subsection{Interpreting Patterns}{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Mean â‰ˆ Median}: Data is roughly symmetric
\item \strong{Mean > Median}: Right-skewed (tail extends right)
\item \strong{Mean < Median}: Left-skewed (tail extends left)
\item \strong{Large SD}: Responses vary widely
\item \strong{Small SD}: Responses are similar
